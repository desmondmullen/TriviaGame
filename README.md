# TriviaGame - Option Two: Advanced Assignment (Timed Questions)
**UNC Full Stack Bootcamp jQuery assignment, January 2018**

A trivia game with timed questions and a tally at the end of the game. This implementation has five questions to answer but there is, of course, no limit to how many or how few questions the engine can run.

**a few bits in addition to the basic requirements**

    * works well and looks good on mobiles and tablets
    * as a courtesy to the player, the countdown time is slightly padded according to the length of the question string.
    * though it displays the count in whole seconds, the countdown timer is updated every tenth of a second for smoother appearance. In a more complex game this would use too many resources but it does the job in this context
    * progress indicators show progression through the questions (only five questions in this version). These are, simply, bullet points with varying opacity.
    * some questions have associated images that are animated across the question display area.

Thank you for looking at this project.
